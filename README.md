# Shannon-Fanno Coding
A group project in Python that was developed for a university assignment on the subject of Code and Information Theory.

**Features:**  
This is a client-server program written in Python using sockets. It simulates a simple exchange of an image between the client and the server. Once the user inputs specific parameters on how the image should be compressed, the Shannon-Fano coding is applied. The image is compressed and sent from the client, the server applies decompression to reconstruct the image.

**Group members involved in this project:**  
Ioannidis Panagiotis, Paravantis Athanasios, Nikas Dionisios
